SAME_FMTOWNS is a ***S***ingle ***A***rcade/***M***achine ***E***mulator for libretro, forked from MAME libretro, which is a fork of MAME (it's the ***SAME***, get it?), and compiles only the Fujitsu FM Towns driver, and then sorts out the claptrap of loading the CD file for emulating.  The name removes the name MAME altogether, as thats what I gather the MAME folks want for a fork like this - MAMEs license is below.

*GAME FILES*
=======
Game files can be either CHD, ISO, or BIN/CUE.  Game support/functionality is whatever the MAME version included supports.  The core currently does not support games that require a boot disk along with the CD image file (that may be added in the future).

*BIOS*
=======
BIOS file (fmtowns.zip) is required, and can go either in the same directory as your ```CHD|ISO|CUE``` files or in the ```retroarch_system_dir/same_fmtowns/bios/``` directory
